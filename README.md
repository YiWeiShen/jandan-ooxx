Download jandan meizitu

It's sad that jandan might be gone soon.

Scrapy meizitu, if you want to implentment python version jandan_load_img(), the speed will be improved.  So does multiprocessing if you use in downloading images.  Here I am not using any of that, only selenium, to slow down the scraping.
